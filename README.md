# An OpenGL World

simply messing around with OpenGL to learn more about graphics programming,\
this uses the classic libraries, glfw, glad, glm, and stb_image, being built with cmake.\

so far ive implemented collisions with some decent player movement in a small static 3d world, lighting, procedural generation and other random things to come\
